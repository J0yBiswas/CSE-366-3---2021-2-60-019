# Assignment 2: Robot Task Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm


**A Genetic Algorithm was developed to optimize task assignments considering task duration, robot efficiency, and task priority. This involved defining individual representation, fitness function, and implementing selection, crossover, and mutation operations.**

The Genetic Algorithm successfully optimized task assignments, resulting in reduced total production time and improved workload balance.


By considering task priorities, critical tasks were effectively prioritized, leading to enhanced overall production efficiency.


The visualization provided valuable insights into task assignments, allowing stakeholders to understand the distribution of tasks, their durations, priorities, and the efficiency of robots.
