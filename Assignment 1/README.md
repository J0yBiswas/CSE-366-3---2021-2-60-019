## Files
- `Dynamic_Robot.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook with the simulation implementation.

**We implemented both `A*` and `UCS` in the same file**

 we add a battery section for the power consumption calcultion.
 
 we calculate the movement power consumption for the robot using `battery_manager` function.
